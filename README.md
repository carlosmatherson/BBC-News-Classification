# BBC News Classification

**DTSA 5510 Unsupervised Algorithms in Machine Learning**

**University of Colorado Boulder**

This notebook explores the classification of BBC news articles into five categories using both unsupervised and supervised machine learning approaches. The unsupervised method uses Truncated SVD for topic modeling and cosine similarity for prediction. To compare this method with a supervised approach, Iâ€™ve implemented a Random Forest Classifier. The project includes exploratory data analysis, hyperparameter tuning, model evaluation, and my final submission to the Kaggle competition.
